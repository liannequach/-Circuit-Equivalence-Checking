# -Circuit-Equivalence-Checking
As digital logic designs become more and more complex, functional verification techniques such 
as verification via simulation become less feasible. As such we must turn to formal verification 
techniques, such as equivalence checking, to ensure that our designs work as expected. In this 
lab, we will attempt to mimic equivalence checking of an unknown module by creating a circuit 
of your own based on the observed behavior of the original circuit.
